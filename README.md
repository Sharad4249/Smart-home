# 🏠 Smart Home App
### A modern, cross-platform mobile application for home automation, built with Flutter and Firebase. This project serves as a comprehensive proof-of-concept for a full-stack IoT application, demonstrating remote device control, real-time status monitoring, and secure user authentication.

## Overview
This application was developed as a one-month summer internship project. The primary goal was to bridge theoretical knowledge of mobile development with practical, real-world application building and cloud service integration. The project highlights a beginner-friendly approach while addressing key aspects of performance and security essential for any connected app.

✨ Key Features
🔒 Secure User Authentication: A robust sign-up and sign-in system powered by Firebase Authentication, ensuring only authorized users can access and control their devices.

📊 Real-time Dashboard: A dynamic and responsive dashboard that displays the live status of simulated smart devices (e.g., lights and fans). The UI adapts to different screen sizes for a seamless experience on both Android and iOS.

💡 Instant Remote Control: Users can instantly toggle the state of devices from anywhere in the world. A simple tap sends a command to the cloud, changing the device's state in a fraction of a second.

🔄 Real-time Data Synchronization: A major technical highlight is the instant synchronization achieved through Firebase Firestore. Any state change is immediately reflected across all connected devices, ensuring everyone sees the most up-to-date status without manual refreshes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Flutter & Dart: The core framework and language for building a single, efficient codebase that compiles natively for Android and iOS.

Firebase: Utilized for back-end services, providing a powerful and scalable foundation:

Firebase Authentication for user management.

Firebase Firestore for real-time data storage and synchronization.
